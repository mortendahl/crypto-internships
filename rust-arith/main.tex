\section*{Motivation}
Experimenting with modern cryptographic primitives (such as supersingular isogenies or lattices) involves assessing their efficiency, both in lab experiments but at some point also in real-world applications. But while it is common for academic experimental libraries to be written in e.g. C/C++, Sage (Python), or Julia, this is not always ideal for experimenting with real-world applications, either because of the language itself or because it implies large software dependencies. Hence these experimental primitives are often somewhat inaccessible for testing in real-world applications as they first need to be re-implemented, potentially by people with less expertise in algebraic optimisations. 

The Rust language is an interesting alternative to C/C++ that could potentially help bridge the gap between lab and real-world experimentation. It has efficiency comparable to other systems languages, yet also offers conveniences such as zero-cost abstraction, type safety, functional constructs, and a modern build system. However, current cryptographic libraries in Rust often start from scratch and re-implement common algorithms for computational number theory and algebra, making the landscape quite ad-hoc


\section*{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Test suitability of Rust as an language for experimental implementations of cryptographic primitives, with a goal of making it easier to not only test these in real-world settings, but also potentially help close the gap to production-ready implementations
\item Provide optimised algorithms for operations commonly used in cryptography (rings, finite fields, polynomials, sampling)
% -- unlike ramp we want more algorithms; unlike num we want something optimised for crypto
%\item focus is on computational number theory/algebra
\item Expected outcome is Rust library with optimised algorithms (potentially open source)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Skills}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suitable for Math/CS student with good mathematical maturity (algebra and algorithms)
\item Some prior programming experience needed (not necessarily in Rust)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item 4-6 month full-time internship position at Snips
\item collaboration with the
  \href{http://lmv.math.cnrs.fr/equipes/crypto/}{CRYPTO} research team
  at Universit√© de Versailles -- Saint-Quentin
\item Suitable for those interested in pursuing research in computational algebra or cryptography
\end{itemize}

\section*{Company}
Snips is young start-up located in the centre of Paris. Our primary focus is on data science and machine learning, but since we encourage the principle of \emph{Privacy by Design}, we also have a growing team working on privacy enhancing technologies, such as secure computation, homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy. We are currently around 40 employees, including data scientists, software engineers, designers, and cryptographers.
