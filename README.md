Snips Crypto Internships, Spring 2017
=====================================

We are offering several internships around cryptography for the Spring 2017 semester. All proposals are aimed at second year master students in the computing sciences (e.g. mathematics, computer science, engineering).


Private Data Analysis
---------------------
Improve data science models by mixing [secure computation protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) with [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count%E2%80%93min_sketch) and [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm) from machine learning. Read [full proposal](/data-analysis/main.pdf).


Computational Algebra in Rust
-----------------------------
Speed up our applications and experimentation with [new cryptographic primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersingular_isogeny_key_exchange) by implementing optimised library for computational algebra in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). Read [full proposal](/rust-arith/main.pdf).


Specialised Zero-Knowledge Proofs
---------------------------------
Make our cryptographic protocols more resilient to cheating users by researching and adapting [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof). Read [full proposal](/zkproofs/main.pdf).


Homomorphic Encryption
----------------------
Apply and benchmark [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Fully_homomorphic_encryption) based on [lattices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography) to our current applications. Read [full proposal](/lattice-he/main.pdf).
